			<h3>Ingredients</h3>
			<!-- Insert horizontal rule -->
			<hr>
			<ul>
				<li>3 egg whites</li>
				<li>1 pinch salt</li>
				<li>1 cup white sugar</li>
				<li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
				<li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<h3>Directions</h3>
			<hr>

		<ol>
			<li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Draw a 9 inch circle on the parchment. An easy way to do this is to draw around the outside of a 9 inch pan with a pencil.</li>
			<li>In a large bowl, beat egg whites on high speed until soft peaks form. Add 3/4 cup of the sugar gradually, while continuing to whip. Make sure sugar is completely dissolved. Mix together the remaining 1/4 cup sugar with the cornstarch; lightly fold into meringue with lemon juice.</li>
			<li>Spread a layer of meringue to fit circle on parchment, approximately 1/4 inch thick. With remainder of mixture, pipe or spoon swirls around the edges to form a shallow bowl shape.</li>
			<li>In a large bowl, combine the cream and half a cup of confectioners sugar, and whip until thickened. Decorate with fruit of your choice; strawberries are excellent.</li>
